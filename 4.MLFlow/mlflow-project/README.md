# MLflow Project

This project demonstrates the use of MLflow for tracking experiments, managing models, and visualizing results in a machine learning workflow.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains datasets and related documentation.
  - **README.md**: Documentation related to the data used in the project, including data sources, formats, and preprocessing steps.
  
- **models/**: Contains model files and related documentation.
  - **README.md**: Information about the models used in the project, including architecture, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.
  
- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and demonstration.
  - **example_notebook.ipynb**: An example workflow demonstrating how to use MLflow for tracking experiments, logging parameters, and visualizing results.
  
- **src/**: Contains source code for the application.
  - **main.py**: The main entry point of the application, initializing the MLflow tracking server and containing the logic for training and evaluating models.
  - **utils.py**: Utility functions for data loading, preprocessing, and model evaluation, including functions for logging metrics to MLflow.

## Requirements

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Set up the MLflow tracking server.
2. Run the `main.py` script to start the training and evaluation process.
3. Use the Jupyter notebook for an interactive demonstration of the workflow.
