    "# Python Logging Module Important Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Configuration**: The `logging.basicConfig()` function is used to configure the logging system with a basic setup.\n",
    "- **Log Levels**: The logging module defines the following log levels, in increasing order of severity:\n",
    "    - `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "    - `INFO`: Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "    - `WARNING`: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.\n",
    "    - `ERROR`: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "    - `CRITICAL`: A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "- **Logging Methods**: The logging module provides several methods for logging messages at different levels:\n",
    "    - `logging.debug()`\n",
    "    - `logging.info()`\n",
    "    - `logging.warning()`\n",
    "    - `logging.error()`\n",
    "    - `logging.critical()`\n",
    "- **Log Message Format**: You can specify the format of log messages using the `format` parameter in `basicConfig()`.\n",
    "- **Log Handlers**: Handlers are used to send the log messages to different destinations (e.g., console, file, network).\n",
    "- **Loggers**: Loggers are used to create a hierarchy of logging messages. You can create custom loggers using `logging.getLogger(name)`."

    "### Logging Levels in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's logging module, logging levels are used to categorize the importance or severity of log messages. Each logging level has a corresponding numeric value, and the logging module provides several predefined levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **DEBUG (10)**:\n",
    "   - Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n",
    "   - Example: `logger.debug('This is a debug message')`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **INFO (20)**:\n",
    "   - Confirmation that things are working as expected.\n",
    "   - Example: `logger.info('This is an info message')`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WARNING (30)**:\n",
    "   - An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g., ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.\n",
    "   - Example: `logger.warning('This is a warning message')`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ERROR (40)**:\n",
    "   - Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.\n",
    "   - Example: `logger.error('This is an error message')`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **CRITICAL (50)**:\n",
    "   - A very serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.\n",
    "   - Example: `logger.critical('This is a critical message')`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Using Logging Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates how to use different logging levels in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "\n",
    "# Configure the logging system\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')\n",

    "logger.critical('This is a critical message')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configuration**:\n",
    "   - `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')` sets up the logging system to display messages of level DEBUG and higher, using a specific format.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a Logger**:\n",
    "   - `logger = logging.getLogger('exampleLogger')` creates a logger named `exampleLogger`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Logging Messages**:\n",
    "   - `logger.debug('This is a debug message')` logs a message with DEBUG level.\n",
    "   - `logger.info('This is an info message')` logs a message with INFO level.\n",
    "   - `logger.warning('This is a warning message')` logs a message with WARNING level.\n",
    "   - `logger.error('This is an error message')` logs a message with ERROR level.\n",
    "   - `logger.critical('This is a critical message')` logs a message with CRITICAL level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the above code, you will see output similar to this:\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Queue**:\n",
    "   - `queue = multiprocessing.Queue()` creates a queue for log messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a QueueListener**:\n",
    "   - `listener = logging.handlers.QueueListener(queue, logging.StreamHandler())` creates a `QueueListener` that reads log messages from the queue and processes them using a `StreamHandler`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Starting the Listener**:\n",
    "   - `listener.start()` starts the `QueueListener`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Creating and Starting Processes**:\n",
    "   - A loop creates and starts multiple processes, each running the `worker` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Worker Function**:\n",
    "   - The `worker` function creates a logger and a `QueueHandler` that sends log messages to the queue.\n",
    "   - The logger logs a debug message.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Waiting for Processes to Complete**:\n",
    "   - The main process waits for all worker processes to complete using `process.join()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Stopping the Listener**:\n",
    "   - `listener.stop()` stops the `QueueListener`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging in a multiprocessing environment requires special handling to ensure that log messages from different processes are handled correctly. By using `QueueHandler` and `QueueListener`, you can set up a robust logging system that works seamlessly across multiple processes. This approach ensures that log messages are processed in a thread-safe manner and provides a centralized way to handle logging in a multiprocessing application."

    "\n",
    "### Types of Handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **StreamHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages to streams such as `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr`.\n",
    "   - Commonly used to output log messages to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **FileHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages to a file.\n",
    "   - Useful for persisting log messages for later analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RotatingFileHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages to a file, with support for log rotation.\n",
    "   - Automatically creates new log files when the current file reaches a certain size.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TimedRotatingFileHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages to a file, with support for time-based log rotation.\n",
    "   - Automatically creates new log files at specified time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SMTPHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages via email.\n",
    "   - Useful for alerting administrators about critical issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **HTTPHandler**:\n",
    "   - Sends log messages to a web server using HTTP.\n",
